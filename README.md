# Capital Bikeshare Before & During COVID-19
15 Jul 2020

## Description

The purpose of this project is to analyze capital bikeshare (cb) usage and trends around Washington, DC before and during the COVID-19 ('coronavirus') pandemic. Data is provided by Capital Bikeshare [here](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).

What is Capital Bikeshare? From the [site](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/how-it-works):
>Capital Bikeshare is metro DC's bikeshare service, with 4,500 bikes and 500+ stations across 7 jurisdictions: Washington, DC.; Arlington, VA; Alexandria, VA; Montgomery, MD; Prince George's County, MD; Fairfax County, VA; and the City of Falls Church, VA. Designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, it’s a fun and affordable way to get around.

*Note: The pandemic begin date for this analysis is considered to be **1  Mar 2020**, since that is close to when most cities/towns started enacting protective measures. Since it is ongoing the end date is TBD, however, data is only available through 30 Jun 2020 at this time...*

## Getting Started/Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Sample Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Built With/Versioning

- Python, v3.7.6
